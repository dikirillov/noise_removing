Welcome to the repository of our university course project! 
This project focuses on developing an application that performs audio cleaning 
for interview recordings by removing unwanted noise. The application 
includes a user-friendly console interface and supports four filtering algorithms.

# Usage
To utilize the application, follow these steps:

1) Provide the input audio file.

2) Specify the output audio file name (optional).

3) Select one or more filtering algorithms to apply from the available options mentioned above.

4) Define time boundaries for each filter to be applied to specific segments of the audio recording (optional).
